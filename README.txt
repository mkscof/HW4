This assignment involved creating a hex graph ADT, and running a game simulation on the
board using DFS to check the winner after each move.

This assignment gave me a better understanding of C++ overall, I had already done DFS in 
the past but I enjoyed learning more about this new language and figuring out language
specific functions.

I felt the assignment was somewhat vague, which was annoying, but overall I enjoyed it
and felt I definitely improved on my C++ coding ability.
